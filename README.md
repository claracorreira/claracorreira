First, I'll say
I apologize for calling
But I saw your face
In a magazine today
Wasn't you, too late
All my tears already falling
Tried to turn the page
But our story wasn't stopping
And it goes
On and on and on
Like a never-ending song
On and on
Like a never-ending song
You and I
Sacrificed my adolescence
Just to waste my time
On the edges of your life
But we've grown too close
Now it can't amount to nothing
I can hear your voice
In the music on the radio
And it goes
